# short about

16 YO, based in Iraq (unfortunately), "aspiring researcher", all of my own repos are on [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/0x177). check out my [webpage](https://0x177.codeberg.page) too

## quick summary of my most ✨*glamorous*✨ work

- [rqism](https://codeberg.org/0x177/rqism): multi backend quantum circuit simulator, rust based, 20 qubit GHZ in 44 microseconds (720x faster than cirq)
- [thimni](https://codeberg.org/0x177/thimni): novel real-time SDF collision algorithm with 2d/3d examples and a destructable fractal demo, w/ [pdf](https://0x177.codeberg.page/thimni.pdf)
- [codenamed SQ-SVM](https://0x177.codeberg.page/qsvm_pdf.html): highly critical analysis of a 2019 quantum machine learning paper with code + pdf
- [LSNN](https://0x177.codeberg.page/snn.html): extremely cache friendly spiking neural network by mimicing limitations of (the overwhelming majority) of natural synapses (the rest of the synapses are important though so an extension is needed to cover them)

## contacts
feel free to contact me whenever, i am eager to connect (and i am incredibly non-busy, will probably reply instantly)

## a more elaborate about section, for whom it may concern
I am passionate about general sciences, and right now my focus is on computer science in general, and specifically quantum computing and neuromorphic artifical intelligence, and SDFs.
I only plan on using github for contributions, I prefer having my own repos on codeberg. I also make [games](https://0x177.itch.io), but they kinda suck. 

My tech stack consists almost entirely of rust, but I am willing to *tolerate* coding in python and julia because scientific programming is like that.
